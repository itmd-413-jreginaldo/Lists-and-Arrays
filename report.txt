Report Summary

1. Did you complete your assignment and did your program run without errors?
   - I completed the assignment but errors did occur.

2. Did your program produce the correct result?
   - The program produced the intended results as described in the specs. The only problem was the slight
   mis-input for one of the totals in the final matrix. The specs described one of the totals being "111.9" but
   when I checked it online, it came out to be "17.9" instead.

3. Did you test your program thoroughly?
   - Yes, I made sure to try to break the program the best I can.

4. How much time did you spend completing your assignment?
   - I spent roughly 2-3 hours total for this assignment. Most of that time was spent figuring out how to
   set up the loops for matrix multiplication.

5. Did you write the program yourself? Did you get any help from anyone?
   - The program was completely written from scratch. The only help I needed to get was some formatting

6. How did you resolve the issues when you encountered obstacles to completing your
program? Did you use Google or other resources to get help? Describe how Google or
other resources was able or not able to assist you.
   - For the errors or questions I ran into while programming, I usually referenced the web / youtube videos and adjusted
   anything I found to properly match the problem.

7. What did you learn from doing this assignment?
   - I have worked with lists before so there was not anything completely new to me for this assignment. However,
   this is my first time working with Jupyter notebook, so it was pretty interesting.

8. Any other information you would like to share with your instructor?
   - For future assignments, when working with fairly in-depth math, should we switch to using numpy or any related math
   libraries or continue attempting to manually creating those functions?
